# Kotlin in examples

Some of the examples in this project. They are implemented as small standalone code snippets. 
Why not unit test? It is because I want to this project to be completely dependency free.

## Code snippets 

- Java interoperability
- Map/Reduce example on collections, using functional syntax
- Comparison of Java 8 streams and Kotlin sequences

## Some other things inside

- extension functions
- data classes
